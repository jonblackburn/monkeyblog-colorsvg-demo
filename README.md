========================

A demonstration of using JQuery to load an Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) image from a referenced file, 
into the current DOM, then interact with it.

For this example I created a simple SVG using Inkscape, then added the id values to the paths using the 
object properties window.  This file is located in the <strong>/resources/</strong> folder and is named 
<em>demoman.svg</em>.

Data included in the <em>data.js</em> file in the resources folder is used in the <em>index.html</em> page along with
<strong>bootstrap</strong> to produce a popover, and to persist the colors of the objects in memory.

<em><strong>Note:</strong> This was created in Visual Studio 2013, but there is no .NET code involved at all.</em>
